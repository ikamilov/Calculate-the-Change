# Calculate-the-Change
A program that calculates the change due a customer by denomination; that is, how many $20 bills, $10 dollar bills, $5 bills, $1 bills, quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies are needed in change.  The inputs are to be the purchase price and the size of the bill tendered by the customer ($100, $50, $20, $10, $5, $1).
